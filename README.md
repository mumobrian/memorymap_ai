# üìò MemoryMapAI Toolkit

A Friendly Guide to Building Conversational AI with Memory in Python

---

## 1. Title & Objective

**Title:** MemoryMapAI ‚Äì A Beginner‚Äôs Guide to Conversational AI with Memory using OpenAI

**Objective:**
This project introduces beginners to conversational AI by showing how memory works in chatbots. We explore:

* Stateless conversations (no memory).
* Manual memory storage using a JSON file.
* A foundation for future expansion with frameworks like LangChain.

The end goal is to help beginners build a chatbot that remembers context, saves tasks, and persists conversations across sessions ‚Äî something you don‚Äôt usually see in ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù examples.

---

## 2. Quick Summary of the Technology

**What is it?**
MemoryMapAI is a Python-based project that demonstrates how to create conversational AI applications using the OpenAI API. It introduces memory management concepts step by step, starting from no memory ‚Üí manual JSON memory ‚Üí framework-ready.

**Where is it used?**

* Chatbots and customer support assistants
* Task managers or productivity apps
* Interactive AI tutors

**One real-world example:**
Think of ChatGPT itself. Unlike stateless bots, it remembers your previous messages, which makes conversations natural and continuous. MemoryMapAI shows how to implement this behavior.

## 4. Installation & Setup Instructions

Clone or create project folder:

```bash
mkdir memorymap_ai
cd memorymap_ai
```

Create virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set up OpenAI API key:

1. Create a `.env` file in your project folder.
2. Add your API key:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

Run the chatbot:

```bash
python memorymap_ai.py
```

Choose a mode when prompted:

* `stateless` ‚Üí No memory
* `manual` ‚Üí Saves chat + tasks in `manual_memory.json`
* `exit` ‚Üí Quit

---

## 5. Minimal Working Example

**What it does:**
A simple chatbot session that remembers tasks and conversation history in manual mode.

**Example code snippet:**

```python
# Start the chatbot in manual memory mode
mode = "manual"
print("Switched to manual memory mode with JSON persistence")

# User adds a task
user_input = "add task Buy milk"
# Bot response (asks for deadline)
"Got it! When should this task be completed?"

# User provides deadline
"Tomorrow 5PM"

# Bot saves it
"Task added: 'Buy milk' with deadline: Tomorrow 5PM"
```

**Expected output:**

```
[INFO] Switched to Manual Memory Mode
You: add task Buy milk
Bot: Got it! When should this task be completed?
You: Tomorrow 5PM
Bot: Task added: 'Buy milk' with deadline: Tomorrow 5PM
```

## Prompt 1: Designing a Beginner-Friendly Chatbot with Memory

**Prompt:**
I want to build a simple Python chatbot for my capstone project that starts in a stateless mode but then evolves to show memory management step by step. I‚Äôm unsure how to structure my code in a way that beginners can understand while also leaving room to extend it.

**My approach so far:**

* Looked at basic chatbot tutorials using while True loops.
* Noticed examples often skip over persistence or memory.
* Identified JSON as a possible way to store conversation state.

**Project structure (so far):**

```
memorymap_ai/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memorymap_ai.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memory.json   (if used for storing memory)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
```

**Questions I asked myself:**

* Should I keep stateless and memory-based versions in the same script or split them into modules?
* How do I name functions so they clearly reflect what they do?
* What‚Äôs the best way for beginners to see the ‚Äúbefore and after‚Äù of adding memory?

**AI Response Summary:**
The AI suggested starting with a very basic stateless chat loop, then adding JSON-based persistence as a separate function. It recommended descriptive function names like `chat_stateless` and `chat_with_manual_memory`. It emphasized that layering complexity helps beginners understand memory without being overwhelmed.

**Helpfulness:**
‚≠ê 10/10 ‚Äì The roadmap made it much easier to teach and document. I now have a clear beginner-to-intermediate learning ladder for my chatbot project.

## Prompt 2: Debugging Setup & Running the Code in VS Code

**Prompt:**
I installed Python and copied the chatbot code, but I‚Äôm running into issues like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai'` and missing API keys. I need a beginner-friendly checklist to run this project smoothly in VS Code.

**My approach so far:**

* Installed Python from the official site.
* Opened the project folder in VS Code.
* Tried running the script directly with `python memorymap_ai.py`.
* Saw multiple errors related to dependencies and `.env` configuration.

**Project structure (at this point):**

```
memorymap_ai/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ memorymap_ai.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ venv/  (virtual environment, after setup)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
```

**Key problem areas I identified:**

* Missing modules like `openai`.
* Unsure how to activate the virtual environment in VS Code.
* `.env` file not being recognized properly.

**AI Response Summary:**
The AI walked me through:

* Creating a virtual environment (`python -m venv venv`).
* Activating it inside VS Code.
* Installing dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
* Adding a `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY=....`.
* Running the app with `python memorymap_ai.py`.

It also explained how to delete and regenerate broken JSON files if persistence fails.

**Helpfulness:**
‚≠ê 9/10 ‚Äì Felt like a step-by-step troubleshooting guide. Very helpful, though I still had to figure out Windows vs. Linux activation on my own.

## Prompt 3: Understanding a Java Project Structure

**Prompt:**
As a beginner Java developer, I see folders like `src/main/java`, `src/test/java`, and a `pom.xml` file, but I‚Äôm not sure where my code should go or how Maven fits into the build process.

**My approach so far:**

* Compared the folder structure to Python projects.
* Looked inside `src/main/java` and saw empty packages.
* Opened `pom.xml` but couldn‚Äôt make sense of all the XML tags.

**Project structure (simplified):**

```
my_java_project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/java/   (application code)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/java/   (test cases)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pom.xml
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ target/          (auto-generated after build)
```

**Questions I asked myself:**

* Should the entry point always go in `src/main/java`?
* Does Maven automatically handle dependencies, or do I need to download JARs?
* What role do plugins in `pom.xml` play?

**AI Response Summary:**
The AI explained that:

* `src/main/java` is for application logic.
* `src/test/java` is for tests.
* `pom.xml` manages dependencies and build configuration.
* The entry point is typically a class with `public static void main(String[] args)`.
* It highlighted that Maven automates dependency management, so I don‚Äôt need to manually download JARs.

**Helpfulness:**
‚≠ê 9/10 ‚Äì Cleared up the Maven mystery and explained the folder structure well. Made me confident about where to place my main Java class.

## 7. Common Issues & Fixes

Like most real-world projects, my chatbot didn‚Äôt work flawlessly the first time. Here are common issues I faced and how I fixed them:

# üõ† Common Issues & Fixes

---

## Issue 1: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai'`

**What happened:**
When I first ran the program, Python complained that the `openai` module was missing.

**Why:**
Dependencies were not installed inside the virtual environment.

**Fix:**
Activate the virtual environment:

* Windows:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
* Mac/Linux:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

Reinstall dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Issue 2: `FileNotFoundError: memory.json not found`

**What happened:**
The memory feature broke because the JSON file didn‚Äôt exist yet.

**Why:**
The program assumes `memory.json` is already there.

**Fix:**
Create an empty JSON file before first run:

```json
[]
```

Save it as `memory.json` in the project folder. From then on, the chatbot will update it automatically.

---

## Issue 3: `ValueError: OPENAI_API_KEY not found`

**What happened:**
The chatbot immediately failed with an API key error.

**Why:**
I had created a `.env` file, but the formatting was wrong (extra spaces, quotes, or missing altogether).

**Fix:**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-real-key-here
```

Make sure there are **no spaces or quotes**.
Restart the terminal so the environment variables reload.

---

## Issue 4: `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError`

**What happened:**
At some point, the chatbot crashed in the middle of saving, leaving `memory.json` corrupted.

**Why:**
The file contained half-written data or invalid JSON which is soo common in early development.

**Fix:**

* Open `memory.json` and check for missing brackets/commas.
* If it‚Äôs beyond saving, delete it and let the program regenerate a fresh file.

---

## Issue 5: Bot Always Responds the Same Way

**What happened:**
No matter what I typed, the bot repeated the same answer.

**Why:**
I had accidentally hardcoded `"Hello"` instead of passing `user_input` into the API call.

**Fix:**
Check that you‚Äôre using:

```python
messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user_input}]
```

instead of any fixed text.
